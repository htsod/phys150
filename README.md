1) Generate Discrete Group of Order n

Input: group order n, a positive integer.


Output: Discrete groups with order n, up to an isomorphism.




2) Check Reduciblity of a Given Representation

Input: Given a representation of a group, could be reducible or irreducible.


Output: Boolean value that tells the reducibility. How many representation it breaks into.


Tools availible: Group Algorithmic Computation (GAP). Further information about this computing language based on group theory will be elaborated here.
