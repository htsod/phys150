### Class Project

1. **Generate Discrete Group of Order n**

- Input: group order n, a positive integer.


- Output: Discrete groups with order n, up to isomorphism.



2. **Check Reduciblity of a Given Representation**

- Input: Given a representation of a group, could be reducible or irreducible.


- Output: Boolean value that tells the reducibility. How many representation it breaks into.
